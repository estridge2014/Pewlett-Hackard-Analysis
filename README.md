# Module 7 Challenge: Upcoming retirements analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 

#### Background: 

Pewlett Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Baby boomers are beginning to retire at a rapid rate, which will lead to many thousands of vacancies. The company until now has relied mostly on excel and VBA to analyze and store data. Iâ€™ve chosen to update these methods by using SQL in order to handle these large employee information datasets. Through data modeling, engineering, and analysis, HR now has a SQL database of employee data, allowing them to answer the important questions of who is retiring, who is eligible for a retirement package and what positions will need to be filled in the near-future.   

#### Current Analysis: 

The company has decided to establish a mentorship program. In order to do this I have analyzed the data provided earlier to H.R to determine the number of employees retiring by title and to identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results 

1. While the number of employees that are retiring is large, before we filtered our tables the results were decieving. Most of the employees eligible for retirement have had multiple roles in the company over the years, having recieved promotions and switched titles. Once Filtered to show only the retiring employee and their final job title, the list became much smaller.  

2. The total number of employees that will be eligible for retirement is 90,398. 

3. The majority of the roles which retirement elegible employees will be leaving are senior roles. Assuming that the senior roles will be filled by promoting current employees, the roles you will be needing to recruit and hire new employees for will be lower roles within the company. 

4. Below displays titles and count of employees who will be retiring.
