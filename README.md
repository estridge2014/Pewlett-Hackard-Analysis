# Module 7 Challenge: Upcoming retirements analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 

#### Background: 

Pewlett Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees. Baby boomers are beginning to retire at a rapid rate, which will lead to many thousands of vacancies. The company until now has relied mostly on excel and VBA to analyze and store data. Iâ€™ve chosen to update these methods by using SQL in order to handle these large employee information datasets. Through data modeling, engineering, and analysis, HR now has a SQL database of employee data, allowing them to answer the important questions of who is retiring, who is eligible for a retirement package and what positions will need to be filled in the near-future.   

#### Current Analysis: 

The company has decided to establish a mentorship program. In order to do this I have analyzed the data provided earlier to H.R to determine the number of employees retiring by title and to identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.
